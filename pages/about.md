# About

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}**.

Through multiple projects in the manufacturing sector, I’ve become deeply motivated by solving real-world problems with field-generated data. This has been the main driver of my professional growth.

My current research interests focus on **reliable AI/ML for real-world operations**, including time-series forecasting, multimodal time series, control & planning, and post-deployment model maintenance (e.g., monitoring and retraining).

I’m currently an **AI/ML Researcher Intern at Boeing AI (BKETC, Seoul, South Korea)**, aiming to build sustainable and autonomous ML systems for industrial applications.
