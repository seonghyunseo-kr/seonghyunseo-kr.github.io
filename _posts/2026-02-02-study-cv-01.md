## 2. Obtaining Images
- Knowing how the image ended up in this form is important if you want to interpret it.

### 2.1. Camera

##### (1) Power $$P$$
The start of image formation can be described by a spectral energy field with power $$P$$.

> **$$P = P(\mathbf{X}, \omega, t, \lambda)$$**
- $$\mathbf{X}$$: position in 3D
- $$\omega$$: direction
- $$t$$: time
- $$\lambda$$: wavelength

The power $$P$$ is created by light leaving light sources, reflacting from surfaces, and eventually arriving at the entrance to the camera. 


##### (2) The Pinhole Camera 
- Pinhole Camera: A light-tight box with a very small hole in the front which models produce an **upside-down** image. 
- Pinhole (*focal point*) is at the origin, and the sensor is on the plane z = *f*. 
    - This plane is the image plane, and *f* is the *focal length*. 
    - We ignore any camera body and regard the image plane as infinite.
    - The focal point has an important, distinctive, property: It cannot be imaged, and it is the only point that cannot be imaged.

### 2.2. Sensing Depth 



### 2.3. Exercises
