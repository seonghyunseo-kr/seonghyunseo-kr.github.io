#### Overview
This talk presents an autonomous model update framework for sustaining post-deployment ML performance under concept drift, integrating drift detection, feature/data refresh, retraining decisions, and artifact/version management.


#### Key takeaways
- **Beyond periodic retraining**: decide *when* and *how* to update based on drift and operational signals.
- **Closed-loop maintenance**: connect detection → data/feature refresh → training/orchestration → versioning.
- **Industrial relevance**: a real steel manufacturing case motivates proactive, autonomous maintenance.

### Abstract
This presentation is focused on autonomous model update strategies aimed at improving the performance and stability of machine learning (ML) models after deployment. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve periodic retraining or retraining triggered by performance falling below predetermined thresholds, these autonomous strategies make informed decisions regarding the optimal timing and procedures for iterative model training, ensuring long-term sustainability. We propose an adaptive framework to facilitate concept drift detection and adaptation, leveraging data/feature extraction, model management, hyperparameter adjustments, and artifacts versioning. An empirical case study from the Korean steel industry highlights the necessity of autonomous retraining strategies after model deployment and the importance of considering these strategies during model development.
