### Abstract
Concept drift (CD) refers to a situation in which the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model aims to predict, unpredictably change over time. Methods for detecting and adapting to concept drift provide insights into scenarios where model performance declines due to these unpredictable changes. We propose an adaptive framework that facilitates concept drift detection and adaptation, leveraging data and feature extraction, model management, hyperparameter adjustments, and artifact versioning. Additionally, a 'buffer period' is introduced to continue data collection after drift detection, during which various 'weights' are applied to update the model. An empirical case study from the Korean steel industry highlights the necessity of autonomous retraining strategies post-model deployment and the importance of considering these strategies during model development.
