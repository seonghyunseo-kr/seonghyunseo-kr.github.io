### Abstract
This poster presents a concept drift detection method that can give an insight into the situation when the performance of the model deteriorates due to concept drift, auto-modeling may not be carried out effectively. We adopt feature selection and various model update strategies into the baseline algorithm, which is a conventional AL Framework, to detect the concept drift effectively and efficiently. These advanced strategies could successfully detect concept drift in real-world scenarios, and ensure consistent performance, and reliable predictions in dynamic environments.
