## Overview
- Context: Early warning reporting and system development for manufacturing quality risk.
- Goal: Predict future warning-level signals and identify likely root causes.
- Outcome: Prototyped forecasting/causal modeling components and contributed to an automated reporting workflow.

## My Contributions
- Implemented a time-series forecasting pipeline (e.g., Prophet) to detect and predict quality-risk signals.
- Built causal analysis components (e.g., PCMCI / transfer entropy) to support root-cause reasoning.
- Supported LLM-based reporting workflows and iterative improvements with stakeholder feedback.

## Tech Stack
- Prophet
- PCMCI
- LLM
