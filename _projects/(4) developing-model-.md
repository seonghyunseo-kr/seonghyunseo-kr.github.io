## Overview
- Context: PoC to validate drift-aware model update strategies in real-world steel manufacturing.
- Goal: Detect concept drift and adapt deployed models to changing data patterns.
- Outcome: Demonstrated feasibility of adaptive update strategy and secured approval for further implementation (per CV summary).

## My Contributions
- Designed PoC experiments to evaluate drift detection and adaptive update strategies under production-like conditions.
- Implemented monitoring and evaluation pipelines to compare baseline vs adaptive approaches.
- Presented findings to stakeholders and supported decision-making for next-phase integration.

## Tech Stack
- Concept Drift
- Monitoring
- Evaluation
